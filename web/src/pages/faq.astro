          <h3 class="faq-question">
            What do the different sorting options mean?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Average DPS:</strong> Mean damage across all iterations<br
            />
            <strong>Max DPS:</strong> Highest damage achieved in any iteration<br
            />
            <strong>Min DPS:</strong> Lowest damage achieved in any iteration<br
            />
            <strong>Consistency:</strong> Specs with lower standard deviation are
            more predictable

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Why does <em>x</em> class perform poorly?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Wowsims is still in <strong>alpha</strong>, and as such the quality
            of each spec varies widely. This is particularly noticeable in
            multi-target encounters where classes APLs have not been fleshed out
            enough yet.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Should I reroll based on these rankings?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            These are theoretical maximums under ideal conditions. So no, take
            these benchmarks with a grain of salt.

        <h2 class="card-title-large">General Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Are these live simulations or static results?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            This website displays static simulation results that were generated
            at a specific point in time, not live simulations. The data
            represents a snapshot of spec performance based on the wowsims
            engine and configurations available when the simulations were last
            run. For live, interactive simulations where you can customize gear
            and settings, visit <a

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How often are rankings updated?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            As of writing, the website is still actively being developed. So all
            simulations are being manually run. In the future, simulation runs
            will be triggered by upstream wowsim releases.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What gear and talents are used?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            In most cases every spec uses the appropriate gearsets/talents
            directly from the <a href="https://github.com/wowsims/mop"
              >wowsims repo</a
            >.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">
            How many iterations are run per simulation?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Currently we are running 10,000 iterations for each category, once
            wowsims has matured I will up this to 50,000.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What raid buffs and debuffs are active?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We use the default raid cooldowns from wowsims, which is bases on an
            ideal 25M raid. Warrior/Shaman simulations are counted in the 4/2
            Stormlash Totem/Skull Banner count, <em>not</em> in addition to.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How is the simulation being run?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We use the wowsims CLI, which accepts JSON configuration files
            containing all simulation parameters (gear, talents, encounter
            settings, etc.). While these files can be manually generated from
            the wowsims WebUI, we use Nix to programmatically create
            configurations for all specs and encounter types. The Nix build
            system then orchestrates running thousands of simulations in
            parallel, aggregates the results into JSON files, and generates the
            static website you're viewing. This approach ensures reproducible
            builds and allows us to efficiently simulate entire spec rankings
            across multiple scenarios.
